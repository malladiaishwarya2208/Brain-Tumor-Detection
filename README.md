# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Deep CNN with preprocessing for MRI analysis. Accuracy: 99.02%
The main motivation behind Brain tumor detection is to not only detect tumor but 
it can also classify types of tumor. So it can be useful in cases such as we have to 
sure the tumor is positive or negative, it can detect tumor from image and return 
the result tumor is positive or not. This project deals with such a system, which 
uses computer, based procedures to detect tumor blocks and classify the type of 
tumor using Convolution Neural Network Algorithm for MRI images of different 
patients
